COMPUTER VISION 
IMAGE CONVOLUTION
by Reah Mae Sardañas

This program replicates the process shown in the video https://fb.watch/pWLNqOIQPE/
Specifically, it performs the following:
    1. divide the image horizontally into equally-spaced strips
	  2. assemble into two images by taking every other strip to form one image
	  3. merge the two images
	  4. divide the merged image vertically into equally-spaced strips
	  5. assemble into two images again by taking every other strip to form one image
	  6. merge the two images

Additionally, it accepts user input for the number of strips and grayscales the image for preprocessing.
